# 🦷 Teeth Diseases Classification using Deep Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **deep learning model** to classify **7 different teeth diseases** from dental images.  
The pipeline includes **resizing, normalization, and data augmentation** to improve accuracy and generalization.

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Image Preprocessing**  
  - Resize images → `64x64x3`  
  - Normalize pixel values → `[0,1]`  

- **Model**  
  - Built with **TensorFlow / Keras**  
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
  - Trained on `train_ds`, validated on `val_ds`, tested on `test_ds`  

- **Evaluation**  
  - Class balance visualization  
  - Display images before & after augmentation  
  - Accuracy & loss curves
